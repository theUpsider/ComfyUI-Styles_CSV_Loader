Title: Failing Test: Loader Returns List Instead of Dict on Invalid CSV

Description:
The test `test_load_invalid_csv` is currently failing. When the loader attempts to read an invalid CSV (e.g., missing columns), it returns a list, but the test expects a dictionary. The loader should always return a dict (or error info as a dict), even for invalid input, to ensure consistent behavior.

Suggested Solution:
Update your loader function so that when it encounters invalid CSV data, it returns an empty dict or a dict with error information, instead of a list.
